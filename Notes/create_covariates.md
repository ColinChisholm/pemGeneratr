##Questions to discuss with Gen
dem_preproc -- generated but not used for anything else

Overland distance to water -- two versions ... minor differences. Which one to keep?
MRVBF 3 versions
Distance to water 2 versions
Flow Accumulation - 3 versions



Grossnickle
fall plant had best shoot and root development but highest drought risk on drier sites.
